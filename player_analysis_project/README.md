# ⚽ Player Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis and comparison of football players from the top 5 European leagues for the 2022-2023 season. The dataset contains information such as **age**, **club**, **goals**, **assists**, and **minutes played**.  
The project computes a **custom rating** for each player and visualizes key insights using several charts. It also includes a simple machine learning model to evaluate how each factor contributes to the player rating.
